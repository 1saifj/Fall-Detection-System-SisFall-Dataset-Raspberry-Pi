# Fall-Detection-System-SisFall-Dataset-Raspberry-Pi
Using MATLAB and Python.

This research investigates the long-short term memory (LSTM) model and Convolutional neural networks (CNN) with LSTM (CNN-LSTM) to recognize the falls and activities of daily livings (ADLs) of ordinary and elderly people, using raw acceleration data from SisFall public dataset. An accuracy of above 96% has been reached in the first 200 epochs of the training process. Furthermore, a real-time prototype for recognizing the falls and ADLs has been implemented and developed using the TensorFlow lite framework and Raspberry PI which resulted in acceptable performances.
